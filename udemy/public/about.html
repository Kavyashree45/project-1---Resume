<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>For example, say you wanted to write a paragraph about dogs. The first thing you would do is write a topic<br>
    sentence, such as, “When it comes to animals, dogs are a great pet.” Now you have a topic, which is not<br> 
    just dogs, but talking about what makes dogs a great pet.<br>
    <br>
    After you’ve come up with your topic sentence, you will then have to write three to five sentences that<br>
    help you explain your fact. For example, in the paragraph about dogs, you may want to write about the <br>
    different things people do with dogs as their pet. The following sentences would be great for a paragraph about dogs.<br>
    <br>
    1.Dogs can help both elderly people and children with their daily life.<br>
    2.Because dogs are so active, they can be great buddies for exercise.<br>
    3.There are many different dogs from the really big to the small ones.<br>
    4.You can train your dog yourself or send it to school in order to make it obedient.<br>
    <br>
    The above four statements help explain why dogs are great pets. Separately they work as great<br>
    sentences, but since they share a common topic in regards to dogs being pets, they can come together to<br>
     make a paragraph.</p>
